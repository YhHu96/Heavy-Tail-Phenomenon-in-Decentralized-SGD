This code is to plot tail index figures for synthetic data results.

The code for Figure 1 and Figure 2 are in Figure 1.ipynb and Figure 2.ipynb.

For Figure 3 and Figure 6, you can use synthetic_data_figure3.ipynb to generate the tail index by changing the parameters' value according to the text. And then use plot_Figure_3&6.ipynb to plot the figures.

For Figure 7, you can use linear_regression_matrix_run.ipynb. It will save the tail index for different decentralized network, then you can use plot_linear_regression_figure7.ipynb to plot the figures.
